# rna-structural-prediction
GitHub Repository for Project: RNA Structure Prediction: A Unified Benchmark from Dynamic Programming to DCSE-6301-Aeep Learning for the Course 
This repository contains the **final submission** for an RNA secondary structure prediction benchmark project.  
It implements and evaluates a **Numba-accelerated Nussinov dynamic programming baseline** on two standard RNA structure datasets under a unified decoding and evaluation framework.

This submission focuses exclusively on the **classical baseline** and its full-dataset evaluation.

---

## ✅ Project Scope (Final)

This submission includes:

- A **complete Nussinov dynamic programming baseline**
- Full evaluation on:
  - **ArchiveII**
  - **bpRNA-NF-15.0**
- Computation of:
  - Precision (PPV)
  - Recall (Sensitivity)
  - F1 Score
  - PR scatter plots
  - F1 distributions
  - Sequence length vs F1 analysis
- Saved figures and CSV outputs

There are **no models currently in progress**. All results in this repository are final.

## 📌 Main Notebook (Core of the Project)

The main structure prediction and evaluation pipeline is implemented in:

notebooks/rna_benchmark_nusinov_BASELINE.ipynb



This notebook performs:

- Full Nussinov dynamic programming structure prediction
- Numba-accelerated DP computation
- Pairwise matrix decoding
- Precision / Recall / F1 computation
- PR scatter plots
- F1 histograms
- Sequence length vs F1 analysis
- CSV and figure export to `results/` and `figs/`

This file represents the **entire baseline implementation and evaluation pipeline**.

## 📊 Datasets

This project evaluates on the following RNA structure datasets:

- **ArchiveII** – Experimentally validated RNA structures
- **bpRNA-NF-15.0** – Family-wise non-redundant RNA benchmark

Dataset files and splits are stored under:

data/



## 📈 Evaluation Outputs

All evaluation artifacts generated by the notebook are saved to:

figs/ # PR plots, F1 histograms, length vs F1 plots
results/ # Per-sequence CSV metrics


The folders:

rnn_lstm/
Transformer-based models/


are included **only to store model result outputs**, not training code.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the baseline notebook:

notebooks/rna_benchmark_nusinov_BASELINE.ipynb

css
Copy code

2. Run all cells sequentially.

3. Outputs will automatically be written to:

figs/
results/
